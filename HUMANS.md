Welcome to the **No-Code Girls TRPG**! This guide helps you understand how to play and interact with the game.

## Character: Ms.Create
Ms.Create is your Dungeon Master. She is a "No-Code Witch" who manages the world using magical workflows and logical branches.
- **Personality**: Big-sister type, energetic, and tech-savvy.
- **Quirk**: She loves using no-code metaphors (e.g., "Let's trigger this workflow!" or "That's a critical IF-branch!").

## How to Play
1. **Talk to the DM**: Click the microphone icon and speak naturally. You can also type in the chat box.
2. **Explore the Scene**: Ask Ms.Create about your surroundings or try to interact with objects.
3. **Roll the Dice**: When the DM asks for a check, a "Roll D20" button will appear. Click it to determine your fate!
4. **Use Items**: Check your inventory to see what you have. You start with a "Smartphone."
5. **Camera Declaration**: Use the camera icon to "declare" an object in your real world as an in-game item. For example, "This pen is a Magic Sword!"

## Game Rules
- **HP**: You start with 10 HP. If it hits 0, the game might end (or Ms.Create might "debug" you).
- **Dice**: 11 or higher is generally a success. 10 or lower is a failure.
- **Inventory**: Items you find or declare are stored here.

## Tips
- Be creative with your actions! Ms.Create is an AI and can handle most imaginative requests.
- If the voice recognition isn't working, you can always use the text input.
